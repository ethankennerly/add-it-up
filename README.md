# ADDITUP

Quickly type the sum in 20 sets.
Press Enter or Space to submit.

The higher you score, the bigger the numbers.

If it feels there are too many digits,
you can add up some of the digit on the right
and Enter these first.

Example:

12
29

You can enter "11", which will make it:

10
31

Then you can enter "41".
