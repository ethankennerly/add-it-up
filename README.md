# ADDITUP

Quickly type the sum in 20 sets.
Press Enter or Space to submit.

The higher you score, the bigger the numbers.

If it feels there are too many digits,
you can add up some of the digit on the right
and Enter these first.

Example:

12
29

You can add up (2 + 9) and enter "11". 
That will remove the 2 and 9 and replace it with 11 more:

10
31

Then you can simply enter "41".
